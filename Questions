what is the use of "next" in user.routes.js?
do we just use one ResponseHandler object (line 13) in user.routes.js and never make a new one?
use index.js in Route folder instead of user.routes directly!
use index.js in app folder instead of the folders directly

* made a new file for mongoose connection in database folder
